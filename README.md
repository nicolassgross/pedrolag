### Hey, you! ðŸ‘‹

<!-- My description -->
My name is [Pedro Luis Arend GonÃ§alves](https://bit.ly/3KjbgCh), I'm 25 y/o and currently working as a Front-end developer at [Plataforma A+](https://www.plataformaamais.com.br/). I've started as a Java programmer a long time ago, but decided to engage more with the users.

<!-- My current project link + some info about it -->
I'm currently working on [this project here](https://github.com/pedrolag), which is a image gallery using Vue.js.
